\section{Introduction}

Tscheme is a static code analyser over a subset of MIT Scheme
that aims to reduce the number of bugs in user's code.
It uses static type analysis to derive supersets of values that can be taken on by
(sub)expressions.
If an empty set is derived, a type error is bound to happen and the error is reported.
If the derived set of values is non-empty, the user is allowed to query the sets of
values expressions can take on to get more information about the code they have written.

There are two common ways of doing static analysis.
One approach is static typing, which imposes type rules which are
over-approximations of what can happen in correct programs.
A good static typing scheme will provide some sort of type safety,
guarantees that will be enforced and that the programmer can rely on.
It is for example possible to statically determine that an integer plus
operator will never be called with a string passed as an argument.
The disadvantage of any reasonable type system over any powerful enough language
is that there will always be valid programs that never violate the notion of
type safety the type system guarantees that will not pass the type check.
That is the type checker will never produce false-positives,
but can produce false-negatives.
As we wanted to have a static analyser that works on an existing Scheme
language (or a subset of), we decided to go in the other direction,
which is a code analyser.
Unlike a type checker, a code analyser will never produce false-negatives,
but can produce false-positive results.
